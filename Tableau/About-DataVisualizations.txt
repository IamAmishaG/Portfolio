After exploring the data via SQL, I have created interactive and informative visual representations of data and compiled them into a dasboard using Tableau Software. 

Advanced charts and graphs such as symbol maps, scatter plots were used to visualize data. The symbol map shows the density of profit statewise.

Interactive filters and parameters were created that allow users to explore data in multiple ways. Dimensional filters and contextual filters were added to the charts to further drive-down the insights. 

Dashboard actions were added to allow users to raise tickets, etc. 

Overall, by incorporating these complex Tableau concepts into my dashboard, a more engaging and informative data visualization that effectively communicates the insights was derived from the Superstore dataset.
